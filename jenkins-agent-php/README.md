# Jenkins inbound-agent + PHP + Libs + New Relic

Jenkins inbound agent + php for legacy freestyle jobs that cannot specify a container and need to have all environment dependencies built into the core container.

https://github.com/BuildScale/Jenkins

for how to more easily just add additional containers and specify which one to execute inside>
